## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
a <- c("L", "K", "Z")
a <- a[-c(1,3)]
print(a)
```
```{r}
a <- c("L", "K", "Z")
a[-c(1,3)] # 不選1，3 
a <- a[-c(1,3)] # 刪去1, 3
```
```{r}
LL <- list('a', T, 183)
LL[c(1,3)] <- NULL 
print(LL) 
```
```{r}
a0 <- a <- c(John=178, Mary=170, Hanson=180)
names(a)

names(a) <- c("John", "Kate", "Hason")
names(a)

a <- a0
names(a)[[2]] <- "May"
names(a)
```
```{r}
a <- a[c(1,3)] # permanently change a

LL <- list("A", T, 17)
LL[[2]] <- NULL # permanently null the second element
```
